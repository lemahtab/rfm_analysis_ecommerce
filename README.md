# RFM Analysis - Case Study

Understanding customer value is one of the biggest challenges for marketing teams around the world. As we accumulate more and more data, it is important to harness the true potential of the data and discover actionable insights to make smart business decisions.

In this exercise, we have transaction data of a retail store (attached). Please categorize the customers into different segments using RFM analysis and suggest data-driven action items for each segment. The tool for analysis and visualization can be of your choice.

Assuming the above data points are related to an eCommerce setup. How would the action items/recommendations change for each segment? Are there any additional digital metrics you would want to track to understand online customer behavior better? Please share those metrics.
